Image on the left is the input image which we downloaded earlier while the image on right is the output image that gets written to disk after the execution of the script. One curious thing that might be noticed between before and after images is that how the white background in the original image changes to actual (where it seems like Beatles are standing in backstage). This happened because most probably the input image had the background padded with white for better contrast and converting it to gray scale and back to color lost that additional padded information in the output image.

Shown above is  the output image that gets written to disk after the execution of the script. Our scipt detected four faces in the input image and drew rectangles to mark them. We shall be be using these rectangles in later part of the tutorial to extract them off the image.
